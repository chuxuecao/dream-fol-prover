# Towards Advanced Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs via First-Order Logic Theorem Proving

[**ðŸ“– Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17104) 


DREAM is a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs' generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their proofs.

## Setup

Install Lean4 compiler:
```
lake init <Project_name>
lake build
```

## Run the Experiment

Script to run our method: 
```
bash script_dream.sh
```
Note: all scripts that has applied Lean4Verifier.py must be put in the first-order folder.
